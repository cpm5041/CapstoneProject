# Client Documentation

This is a blog site created by Chris Marcenelle for General Assembly's Capstone Project.

The motivation for this was when we were looking for our new family dog (Lucy, below), we noticed some breeder sites were not that visually appealing or functional. I realized there was an opportunity to provide a service to anyone who wanted to list available pets for adoption.

By using this site, users can add available pets for visitors to view and contact them about. This would be useful for pet owners or breeders who would not have the time or resources to build out a site to list different pets and litters.
Users can create pets, view all pets submitted by other users, and update or delete their own content.
Also, when viewing other other's pets, it lists their contact info
in order to get in touch.

## Testing and Issue Management
 - Planned to wrap up major feature development Wendesday of project week to allow time for testing and bug fixes.
 - Reviewed code with peers and requested that they test to find this I may have missed.
 - Spent time at end of everyday testing our most recently deployed code

# Client Challenges and Accomplishments
Challenges
- Prework: It was difficult to plan ahead of project week for this as I was working through a project 3 resubmission and had to focus attention accordingly.
- Framework: I would have liked to tried to incorporate a front end framework, most likely REACT as my team will be using it when I return. By the time I completed MVP functionality, I did not have enough time where I would have felt comfortable implementing a framework.
- Images: As it stands now, I have it so a user can include an image URL to a hosted image. A nice to have would have been to include the ability to upload picstures.


## Dependencies

Install with `npm install`.

-   [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
-   [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
-   [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com)

At the beginning of each cohort, update the versions in
[`package.json`](package.json) by replace all versions with a glob (`*`) and
running `npm update --save && npm update --save-dev`. You may wish to test these
changes by deleting the `node_modules` directory and running `npm install`.
Fix any conflicts.

## Installation

1.  [Download](../../archive/master.zip) this template.
1.  Unzip and rename the template directory.
1.  Empty [`README.md`](README.md) and fill with your own content.
1.  Move into the new project and `git init`.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Structure

Dependencies are stored in [`package.json`](package.json).

Do not configure `grunt` packages directly in the
[`Gruntfile.js`](Gruntfile.js). Instead, store configurations in the
[`grunt`](grunt) directory. You won't need a top-level key, since that's
generated by the `Gruntfile.js` based on the filename of the configuration
object stored in the `grunt` directory.

Developers should store JavaScript files in [`assets/scripts`](assets/scripts).
The "manifest" or entry-point is
[`assets/scripts/index.js`](assets/scripts/index.js). In general, only
application initialization goes in this file. It's normal for developers to
start putting all code in this file, but encourage them to break out different
responsibilities and use the `require` syntax put references where they're
needed.

Developers should set `config.apiOrigins.production` (and
`config.apiOrigins.development` if it differs from the default).  With
`apiOrigins` set, developers may rely on `config.apiOrigin` as the base for API
URLs.

Developers should store styles in [`assets/styles`](assets/styles) and load them
from [`assets/styles/index.scss`](assets/styles/index.scss).

Developers should use [getFormFields](forms.md) to retrieve form data to send to
an API.

To deploy a browser-template based SPA, run `grunt deploy`.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `grunt nag` or just `grunt`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains
-   `grunt reformat`: reformats all your code in a standard style
-   `grunt <server|serve|s>`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads
-   `grunt test`: runs any automated tests, depends on `grunt build`
-   `grunt build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
